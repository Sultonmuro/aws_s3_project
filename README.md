AWS Project - Web Application & CRUD Interface for Iris Dataset
This project demonstrates how to set up a web application for managing the Iris dataset using a CRUD interface. The application is hosted on Amazon S3, and the interface allows users to create, read, update, and delete records of the Iris dataset.

Project Overview
This project includes a web interface that allows users to interact with the Iris dataset. The dataset consists of measurements of Iris flowers, such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width, along with the species name.

Features:
Create: Add new entries to the Iris dataset.
Read: View the entire dataset or a single entry by ID.
Update: Edit existing dataset entries.
Delete: Remove dataset entries by their ID.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

AWS Account: You need an AWS account for deploying the application.
Node.js & NPM: Install Node.js for local testing and managing dependencies.
Git: Version control for managing the codebase.
Python (optional): If you’re using Python for the CRUD logic, ensure Python is installed.
Setting up the environment:
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd aws_project
Install necessary dependencies (if any):

For a Flask app or similar Python framework:

bash Копировать Редактировать pip install -r requirements.txt Setup Instructions

Create the S3 Bucket To deploy the web app to an S3 bucket, follow these steps:
Log in to your AWS Management Console.

Create an S3 bucket:

Go to the S3 service.

Click on Create Bucket.

Choose a bucket name (this name should be globally unique).

Select the appropriate region (e.g., us-west-2).

Leave other settings as default, or configure according to your needs.

Upload Web Application Files:

After creating the bucket, upload your index.html, CSS, JavaScript, and other necessary files into the S3 bucket.

Make sure your index.html file is set as the index document.

Set Bucket Permissions:

Ensure the bucket is publicly accessible for the web application to be visible.

Go to the Permissions tab and update the Bucket Policy to allow public access. Here’s an example bucket policy to allow public read access:

json Копировать Редактировать { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": "", "Action": "s3:GetObject", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::/" } ] } 2. Deploy the Web Application Once you have uploaded the files to the S3 bucket and configured the necessary permissions, your web application should be accessible via the bucket URL.

The URL will look like: http://.s3-website-.amazonaws.com

Web Application Features CRUD Interface for Iris Dataset: Create: Users can create new Iris dataset entries using a form. The form accepts the following fields:

ID

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Species

Read: Users can fetch and display all Iris dataset entries, or retrieve a single entry by its ID.

Update: Users can update specific Iris dataset entries by ID, modifying any of the fields.

Delete: Users can delete entries from the dataset by providing the record's ID.

Technologies Used: HTML: For creating the structure of the web application.

CSS: For styling the web pages.

JavaScript: For managing the CRUD operations and interacting with the back-end.

Amazon S3: For hosting the web application.

API for CRUD Operations: (You can connect to an API such as Flask, Node.js, etc. for performing the operations.)

Deployment on AWS Deploying to S3: Ensure all web application files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are in your S3 bucket.

Make sure your S3 bucket is set up for static website hosting.

Ensure all permissions are correctly configured for public access (for users to access the site).

Once the deployment is complete, your application will be available for users to access globally via the public URL provided by S3.
